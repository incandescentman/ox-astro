#+TITLE: Suggested Enhancements for ox-astro
#+AUTHOR: Gemini, Claude
#+DATE: 2025-11-26

* High Priority

** TODO Batch Export Command [Low complexity]
Export all Org files in a directory with one command: =M-x org-astro-export-directory=

Most immediate value for life-web workflow—after changing settings like =org-astro-id-link-base-path=, you need to regenerate everything.

** TODO Responsive Images [Low complexity]
Add =org-astro-image-layout= config to include =layout="responsive"= on =<Image />= components. Quick win for performance—Astro 5.0+ handles srcset/sizes automatically.

** TODO SVG Components [Medium complexity]
Detect =.svg= files and generate component imports (=import Icon from './icon.svg'=) instead of =<Image />= tags. Enables CSS styling and standard Astro patterns. Requires Astro 5.7+.

* Medium Priority

** TODO Footnote Handling [Low complexity]
Convert Org footnotes =[fn:1]= to Markdown syntax =[^1]=. Useful for academic writing.

** TODO Enhanced Error Reporting [Medium complexity]
Expand =broken-links.json= approach to cover missing images, invalid front matter, malformed syntax. Point to problematic line numbers.

* Low Priority

** MAYBE Content Collections Schema Awareness [High complexity]
Validate front matter against Astro's TypeScript schema. Skip this—Astro already validates at build time, and parsing TS from Elisp is complex with little benefit.

** MAYBE Custom Component Shortcodes [Medium complexity]
Embed Astro components via =#+BEGIN_ASTRO card, title="..."=. Low priority since =BEGIN_EXPORT mdx= works.

** MAYBE Auto-Export on Save [Low complexity]
Minor mode to export on save. Could be distracting; would need debouncing and opt-in per file.

** MAYBE Picture Component [Medium complexity]
Generate =<Picture />= for multi-format images (AVIF, WebP). Low priority—=<Image />= covers most cases.

** MAYBE Generic Asset Handling [Low complexity]
Copy ZIPs, videos to =public/=. PDFs already supported; this is niche.

* Implemented

** DONE Absolute Route Mode for ID Links [2025-11-26]
Config =org-astro-id-link-base-path= outputs =/notes/path/slug= instead of =../path/slug.mdx=.

#+begin_src emacs-lisp
(setq org-astro-id-link-base-path "/notes")
#+end_src

** DONE Remote Image Caching
=org-astro--download-remote-image= fetches remote URLs to local assets, ensuring Astro optimization.

** DONE PDF Asset Handling
=ox-astro-pdf-handlers.el= copies PDFs to =public/pdfs/= and rewrites links.
