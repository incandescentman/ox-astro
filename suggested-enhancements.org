#+TITLE: Suggested Enhancements for ox-astro
#+AUTHOR: Gemini

This file contains a list of potential new features for the ox-astro exporter, grouped by category.

* Content and Syntax Enhancements
** Footnote Handling
Automatically convert Org-style footnotes (`[fn:1]`) into the standard Markdown footnote syntax (`[^1]`), which Astro can then process.

* Deeper Astro Integration
** Implemented: Absolute Route Mode for ID Links
   This enhancement was implemented. Users can now configure `org-astro-id-link-base-path` to output absolute routes (e.g., `/notes/stories/my-story`) for `[[id:...]]` links, addressing the Astro routing incompatibility with relative MDX paths. This was preferred over adding support for `[[file:...]]` links directly between Org posts due to the robustness and best practices of `org-roam`'s ID system.

** Custom Component Shortcodes
   Allow users to embed their own Astro components directly from Org mode. For example, a special block syntax could be used to invoke a component and pass it properties (e.g., `#+BEGIN_ASTRO card, title="My Card" ...`).
** Content Collections Schema Awareness
   If the Astro project uses Content Collections, the exporter could be configured to read the collection's schema and validate the Org file's front matter during export, ensuring type safety and preventing errors.

* Workflow and User Experience
1.  *Batch Export Command*: Add a command to export all Org files in a specified directory (e.g., `org-astro-export-directory`), which would be useful for regenerating an entire site at once.
2.  *Auto-Export on Save*: Implement a minor mode that automatically triggers the export process whenever an Org file is saved, providing a live-preview-like experience.
3.  *Enhanced Error Reporting*: If an export fails (e.g., a linked image is missing), provide more descriptive errors in the `*Messages*` buffer that point directly to the problematic line in the Org file.

* Asset Management
1.  *Generic Asset Handling*: Extend the asset-copying logic to handle non-image files like PDFs, ZIP archives, or videos. These could be copied to the `public/` directory and linked with a standard `<a>` tag.
2.  *Remote Image Caching*: Add an option to download remote images, save them locally to the assets folder, and process them with Astro's `<Image>` component. This would improve performance and prevent broken images if the remote source goes down.
