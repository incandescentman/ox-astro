** Tasks [1/3]

*** TODO run
- [ ] part 1
- [ ] part 2
*** STARTED walk
*** DONE crawl

** Wikipedia Photography Assignment: Fringe 2025
*** üéØ Main Priorities

https://jaydixit.com/

**** Focus on performers from the Global South
- This is the top priority to justify the optics of our Fringe presence.
- Prioritize acts that *don't yet have Wikipedia pages*.
- Venues like *Summerhall* often host strong international content.

**** Cover visually interesting, high-energy shows
- Think: *dance, acrobatics, physical theater*, and visually dynamic performances.
- International shows tend to be especially compelling and camera-friendly.

**** Photograph comedy showcases with large casts (6-12 performers)
- Target venues: *Monkey Barrel, Assembly, Pleasance*
- These are great opportunities to photograph multiple emerging comedians in one go.
- We may *reimburse up to $250* (possibly more) for showcase tickets.

*** ‚úÖ Volume Goals
- Aim to photograph *4-5 acts per day*
- Try to hit a total of * ~50 acts over 10 days*

- Mix high-profile acts (e.g., Hannah Gadsby level) with lesser-known performers
- Many solo acts will be thrilled to be photographed

*** üìù Other Notes
- Don't worry too much about press passes --- many showcases aren't worth the admin hassle.
- Bryan and Philip are already covering major names and have relationships; follow their lead for high-profile opportunities.
- Quejaytee also has good leads.
- Wiki pages are helpful, but not the main goal here --- *representation is*.

*** üß≠ Guiding Principle
: *Prioritize coverage of performers from the Global South.* That's the core mission and the best way to justify our presence at Fringe.

***  extra                          :ARCHIVE:noexport:
so. your assigning should be visually interesting things in the global south and then comedy showcases with lots of people. 6 or more.  (we can reimburse you for those)

you will like those.

too much a headache to try to get press for the showcases

so, dance and acrobatics

funny people standing by themselves, bryan and philip are on
they get to choose because this is like "their event"
and they also have relationships

i also find the international shows are nicer and they are just...cooler to watch

let me know if you need help

if you can do 4-5 things a day that's great
Monkey Barrel, Assembly and  Pleasance will have good showcases

we can subsidize maybe ... USD$250 for the showcases. maybe more once you run out

i wouldn't worry too much about it for you
since you should do shows in the global south
that probably DONT have wiki pages

you probably want to shoot like 50 things over next 10 days
some can be "cheap," like just a normal performer. they would be thrilled

others can be like Hannah Gadsby, which Bryan got last year

a good number of the 50
should be global south

like if there is one guiding principal

for you:

summerhall
global south

then there are these showcases with 6-12 comedians. pleasance has. and assembly has.

But justify our housing spend for fringe optically we NEED a lot of global south

Otherwise it's like sending a bunch of people to fringe to hang out

Bryan and philip are on it


And they have their thing
 quejaytee also good

You can basically just do
 we need folks to be self sufficient
 for this one with some large top level
guidance


There is infinite things to shoot


Having wiki pages helpful. but not main principle here at fringe

** Venues
Yes. Summerhall is one of the Fringe venues.  One of the best. Probably most tightly curated is

-‚Å†  ‚Å†Summerhall (year round programming)
-‚Å†  ‚Å†‚Å†Pleasance
-‚Å†  ‚Å†‚Å†Assembly
-‚Å†  ‚Å†‚Å†Underbelly
-‚Å†  ‚Å†‚Å†Gilded Balloon
-‚Å†  ‚Å†‚Å†Monkey Barrel (year round comedy)

then separately EICC has a few fancy shows that are more professional.

* other
Some allocation for book events (so edinburgh book helps checks that off). And fringe counts against theater performance for us and Global South. Fringe good bc it's so large so lots of photos. Edinburgh International Festival smaller. More work. So fine if someone wants to get. But I won't push on it since it's somewhat duplicative of the kind of stuff we can get from
Fringe. Maybe higher chance of wikipedia pages.
