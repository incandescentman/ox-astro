* 2025-11-26 Wednesday - Absolute Route Links & Narrowing Fix

** Summary
Addressed two major issues:
1.  **Narrowed Buffer Export**: Fixed a bug where exporting a narrowed buffer (e.g., a subtree) would fail to capture metadata or export the full content if the cursor was deep in the buffer.
2.  **Astro Routing**: Implemented an "Absolute Route Mode" for org-roam ID links to ensure they resolve to valid Astro URLs (e.g., `/notes/collection/id`) instead of broken relative MDX file paths (e.g., `../collection/id.mdx`).
3.  **Portability**: Removed hardcoded debug log paths from the source code, making the package distributable.

** Changes
- **`ox-astro.el`**:
  - Updated `org-astro-export-to-mdx` to unconditionally reset `point` to `(point-min)` before processing. This ensures exports always start from the beginning of the visible region (whether full buffer or narrowed subtree).
  - Replaced hardcoded debug log path with `org-astro-debug-log-file` custom variable.
- **`ox-astro-config.el`**:
  - Added `org-astro-id-link-base-path` custom variable (default: `nil`) to control absolute route generation.
- **`ox-astro-helpers.el`**:
  - Updated `org-astro-link` to check `org-astro-id-link-base-path`. If set, it computes the absolute route using the new `org-astro--compute-collection-id` helper. If nil, it falls back to relative MDX paths.
  - Updated debug helpers to use the new customizable log file variable.
- **Tests**:
  - Added `test/date-title-and-subtree-test.el` to regression test the narrowing/cursor fix.
  - Added `test-id-links.el` test case for absolute route mode.
  - Updated `test-debug.el` to use the portable log file variable.

** Impact
- **Reliable Subtree Exports**: Users can now export subtrees confidently regardless of cursor position.
- **Working Navigation**: Links between posts now work correctly in deployed Astro sites when `org-astro-id-link-base-path` is configured (e.g. to `/notes`).
- **Portability**: The package no longer depends on a specific user's filesystem for debug logging.

* 2025-11-26 Wednesday - Enhancements Documentation Updated

** Summary
Updated `suggested-enhancements.org` to reflect the current implementation status and prioritization of various features, including new opportunities from Astro 5.x image handling.

** Changes
- Reorganized `suggested-enhancements.org` into priority-based sections (High, Medium, Low Priority / Future Opportunities, Implemented / Completed).
- Marked "Remote Image Caching", "Absolute Route Mode for ID Links", and "PDF Asset Handling" as "Implemented / Completed".
- Added "Responsive Images" and "SVG Components" as "High Priority" opportunities, and "Picture Component Support" as "Low Priority / Future Opportunity", reflecting their status based on Astro 5.x features.

* 2025-12-01 - Exporter link handling hardening
** Summary
Fixed MDX parse failures caused by raw `<file:///...>` links when exporting `file+emacs`/`file+sys` links.
** Changes
- `ox-astro-helpers.el`: `org-astro-link` now rewrites non-image `file+emacs`/`file+sys` links to standard Markdown links (`file://...`), preventing invalid JSX autolinks in MDX output. Org buffers remain untouched during export.
** Impact
- Eliminates MDX parse errors from valid org file links (e.g., project references) without mutating source org files.
