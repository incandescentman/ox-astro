#+TITLE: Architecture Decision Records (ADRs)
#+DATE: 2025-10-05

* What Are ADRs?

Architecture Decision Records (ADRs) are short documents that capture important architectural and design decisions made during development, including:
- The context and problem being solved
- The decision made
- Alternatives considered
- Consequences (positive and negative)

* Why Use ADRs?

- **Preserve context**: Future developers understand *why* decisions were made
- **Prevent revisiting**: Avoid rehashing already-considered alternatives
- **Knowledge transfer**: New contributors can quickly understand the system's evolution
- **Linkable history**: Easy to reference from code, docs, and discussions

* ADR Index

Currently no ADRs. When created, they will appear here.

* How to Create an ADR

1. Create a new file: =adr-NNNN-short-title.org= (e.g., =adr-0001-derive-from-ox-md.org=)
2. Use the template below
3. Add to this index
4. Link from relevant documentation (design-architecture.org, codebase-wisdom.org)

* ADR Template

#+begin_src org
,#+TITLE: ADR-NNNN: [Short Title]
,#+DATE: YYYY-MM-DD
,#+STATUS: [Proposed | Accepted | Deprecated | Superseded]

,* Context
What is the issue we're facing? What forces are at play?

,* Decision
What decision did we make?

,* Alternatives Considered
1. Option A - why rejected
2. Option B - why rejected

,* Consequences
,** Positive
- Benefit 1
- Benefit 2

,** Negative
- Trade-off 1
- Trade-off 2

,* References
- [[file:../design-architecture.org::*Related Section][Related architecture]]

* When to Create an ADR

Create an ADR when:
- Making a significant architectural change
- Choosing between multiple viable approaches
- Establishing a new pattern or convention
- Deprecating an existing approach
- A decision will impact future development

Don't create ADRs for:
- Obvious or trivial choices
- Temporary workarounds
- Implementation details that don't affect architecture
