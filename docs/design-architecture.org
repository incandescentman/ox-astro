#+TITLE: ox-astro Design Architecture
#+DATE: 2025-10-05
#+TAGS: architecture, design, technical-overview

* TL;DR

- *This system*: Org Mode exporter that generates Astro-compatible MDX files with automatic asset management
- *Core components*: Derived backend (ox-md), three-phase pipeline, image/PDF processors, front matter generator
- *Mental model*: Think of it as a "smart copy" — it detects, transforms, and relocates assets while preserving relationships
- *Key gotchas*:
  - Slug generation happens in 3 places (must stay synchronized)
  - Image data can be lost between export phases (uses dual storage)
  - Config lookups need whitespace tolerance
  - Keyword insertion must respect org-roam properties
- *Last major update*: 2025-10-05 (Whitespace-tolerant config lookups)

* For LLM Context

This document defines the technical architecture of ox-astro:
- **Key invariants**: Export happens in 3 phases; all image processing in pre-processing; keyword insertion via =org-astro--upsert-keyword-after-roam=
- **When to update**: When adding major features, changing pipeline phases, or modifying asset handling
- **Where this connects to code**:
  - =ox-astro.el= lines 390-445 (backend definition)
  - =ox-astro-handlers.el= (filter functions)
  - =ox-astro-helpers.el= (transcoding functions)

* System Overview

ox-astro is an Org Mode export backend that extends =ox-md.el= to generate Astro-compatible MDX files. It handles the complete workflow from Org source to production-ready MDX, including asset management, front matter generation, and content transformation.

** What Makes It Different
Unlike standard markdown exporters, ox-astro:
- Automatically detects and processes images from multiple sources (links, raw paths, remote URLs)
- Copies assets to the correct Astro project structure
- Generates ES6 import statements for images
- Creates proper front matter from Org keywords
- Handles PDFs and other binary assets
- Supports org-roam integration

* Architecture Overview

** Three-Phase Processing Pipeline

The export process happens in three distinct phases:

*** Phase 1: Parse Tree Processing (Pre-processing)
*When*: Before any transcoding begins
*What happens*:
- Parse entire Org buffer into element tree
- Collect all image and PDF paths
- Process and copy assets to destination folders
- Update source Org file with new paths
- Store import data for later phases

*Key functions*:
- =org-astro-prepare-images-filter= — Main pre-processing filter
- =org-astro--collect-images-from-tree= — Image detection
- =org-astro--collect-pdfs-from-tree= — PDF detection
- =org-astro--process-image-path= — Asset copying and import generation

*Why this matters*: Asset processing must happen before transcoding because we need to update the source file and collect import data that will be used in later phases.

*** Phase 2: Element Transcoding
*When*: After parse tree processing
*What happens*:
- Convert individual Org elements to MDX equivalents
- Transform TODO items to task lists
- Process links and images
- Handle special code blocks
- Convert tables to markdown

*Key functions*:
- =org-astro-heading= — Headlines and TODO items
- =org-astro-link= — Links (preserves markdown, wraps bare URLs)
- =org-astro-paragraph= — Paragraphs with image detection
- =org-astro-plain-text= — Raw text with URL/image processing
- =org-astro-src-block= — Code blocks with special types
- =org-astro-table=, =org-astro-table-row=, =org-astro-table-cell= — Table conversion

*Why this matters*: Each element type gets specialized handling. This is where Org syntax becomes MDX.

*** Phase 3: Final Output Processing (Post-processing)
*When*: After all elements have been transcoded
*What happens*:
- Assemble complete MDX file (front matter + imports + body)
- Apply final transformations (URL wrapping, reference link cleanup)
- Generate debug output if enabled

*Key functions*:
- =org-astro-body-filter= — Assembles front matter, imports, and body
- =org-astro-final-output-filter= — Final string transformations

*Why this matters*: Front matter and imports must be added after body is generated. Final cleanup happens here.

** Mental Model: Smart Asset Pipeline

Think of ox-astro as an intelligent asset pipeline:

```
Org File with Local Images
         ↓
    [Detection Phase]
    - Scan for images/PDFs
    - Find from links, raw paths, URLs
         ↓
    [Processing Phase]
    - Download remote images
    - Copy to Astro assets/
    - Generate camelCase var names
    - Create import statements
         ↓
    [Transformation Phase]
    - Replace raw paths with <Image> components
    - Update source Org file
    - Assemble MDX output
         ↓
Production MDX with Imports
```

* Core Subsystems

** 1. Asset Management System

*** Image Processing
*Goal*: Transform local/remote images into optimized Astro Image components

*Flow*:
1. Detection → 2. Downloading (if remote) → 3. Copying → 4. Sanitization → 5. Import generation → 6. Component creation

*Key patterns*:
- **Post-specific folders**: Each post gets =src/assets/images/posts/{slug}/=
- **Astro alias paths**: Use =~/= prefix (maps to =src/=)
- **Variable naming**: Filename → camelCase, prepend =img= if starts with number
- **Multi-source detection**: Org links, raw paths, remote URLs, protocol-relative URLs

*Files*: =ox-astro-image-handlers.el=

*** PDF Handling
*Goal*: Copy PDFs to public directory with proper site-relative URLs

*Flow*:
1. Detection → 2. Copying to =public/pdfs/{slug}/= → 3. Source update → 4. URL generation

*Differences from images*:
- Target: =public/= instead of =src/assets/=
- No imports: Direct URL serving
- Simple markdown links: No component wrapping
- URL encoding: Spaces become =%20=

*Files*: =ox-astro-pdf-handlers.el=

** 2. Front Matter System

*** Data Collection
Front matter is assembled from multiple sources with fallback logic:

| Field | Primary Source | Fallback |
|-------|---------------|----------|
| title | =#+TITLE= | First level-1 headline |
| publishDate | =#+PUBLISH_DATE= or =#+DATE= | Current time |
| excerpt | =#+EXCERPT=, =#+SUBHED=, or =#+DESCRIPTION= | First paragraph |
| author | =#+AUTHOR= | "Jay Dixit" |
| image | =#+COVER_IMAGE= | First image in document |
| tags | =#+TAGS= | None |
| categories | =#+CATEGORIES= | None |
| visibility | =#+VISIBILITY: value= | None |
| draft | =#+STATUS: draft= | =false= |

*** Keyword Insertion Pattern
When metadata is missing, ox-astro adds it to the source file:
- Uses =org-astro--upsert-keyword-after-roam= to respect org-roam =:PROPERTIES:=
- Handles narrowed buffers (subtree exports) correctly
- Auto-generates slug from title if missing
- Saves buffer after insertion

*Why this matters*: Creates a virtuous cycle where exported files gain better metadata over time.

*Files*: =ox-astro-helpers.el= (=org-astro--get-front-matter-data=, =org-astro--gen-yaml-front-matter=)

** 3. Configuration System

*** Known Posts Folders
Maps nicknames to destination configurations:

```elisp
'(("blog" . (:path "~/projects/blog/src/content/blog"))
  ("docs" . (:path "~/projects/docs/src/content/docs"))
  ("roam" . (:path "~/projects/roam/src/content"
             :preserve-folder-structure t)))
```

*Features*:
- Nickname lookup: =#+DESTINATION_FOLDER: blog= (alias =#+DESTINATION-FOLDER: blog=)
- Absolute path support: =#+DESTINATION_FOLDER: /full/path= (alias =#+DESTINATION-FOLDER: /full/path=)
- Folder structure preservation: Maintains relative paths from source root
- Whitespace tolerance: Handles trailing/leading spaces gracefully

*Lookup pattern*:
```elisp
(cl-find nickname org-astro-known-posts-folders
         :test (lambda (needle pair)
                 (string= needle (string-trim (car pair)))))
```

*Files*: =ox-astro-config.el=, =ox-astro.el= (resolution logic)

** 4. Content Transformation System

*** Special Transformations
- **TODO items** → GitHub task lists (=- [ ]= / =- [x]=)
- **Bare URLs** → =<LinkPeek url="..." />= components
- **Raw image paths** → =<Image src={varName} alt="..." />= components
- **Special code blocks** (user/prompt/quote) → Preserved with formatting
- **Tables** → Markdown format (not HTML)

*** Link Handling Strategy
Links are processed in transcoding phase (not final filter) to avoid regex complexity:
- Markdown links → Preserved exactly
- Bare URLs → Wrapped in LinkPeek
- Reference-style links → Definitions preserved
- Image links → Converted to Image components

*Why this design*: Processing during transcoding gives us proper AST access instead of regex hacks.

*Files*: =ox-astro-helpers.el= (=org-astro-link=, =org-astro-paragraph=, =org-astro-plain-text=)

* Data Flow Diagrams

** Manifest Collector
- Single pass driven by `org-astro--build-image-manifest`
- Local helper defined via `cl-labels (register-entry ...)` for consistent scope
- Result cached to `:astro-image-manifest` and reused across export phases

** Image Processing Flow
```
User writes Org file
     ↓
[[file:/path/image.png]] or raw path
     ↓
org-astro-export-to-mdx triggered
     ↓
Phase 1: Parse tree processing
  - org-astro--collect-images-from-tree
  - org-astro--collect-raw-images-from-tree-region
  - org-astro--process-image-path
    → Copy to src/assets/images/posts/{slug}/
    → Generate variable name (camelCase)
    → Create import data
  - Update source Org file with new path
     ↓
Phase 2: Transcoding
  - org-astro-paragraph detects image
  - Uses stored import data
  - Generates <Image src={var} alt="..." />
     ↓
Phase 3: Final assembly
  - org-astro-body-filter adds imports at top
  - Front matter + imports + body combined
     ↓
Output: MDX file with proper imports and components
```

** Export Decision Flow
```
User triggers export
     ↓
Check #+DESTINATION_FOLDER keyword
     ↓
Is it a known nickname? ──Yes──→ Use configured path
     ↓ No                              ↓
Is it absolute path? ────Yes──→ Use directly
     ↓ No                              ↓
Prompt user to select ───────────────→ └─→ Resolve path
     ↓
Preserve folder structure? ──Yes──→ Calculate relative path from source root
     ↓ No                              ↓
Use base destination ─────────────────→ └─→ Final destination
     ↓
Export to destination/slug.mdx
```

* Key Design Decisions

See [[file:the-ox-astro-approach.org][the-ox-astro-approach.org]] for complete rationale. Summary:

| Decision | Rationale | Trade-off |
|----------|-----------|-----------|
| Derive from ox-md | Inherit standard markdown for free | Tied to ox-md behavior |
| Three-phase pipeline | Separate concerns (assets, transcoding, assembly) | More complex than single pass |
| Custom TODO conversion | Interactive task lists better for web | Must override default behavior |
| Dual storage for images | Prevent data loss between phases | Extra state management |
| Whitespace-tolerant lookups | Handle config errors gracefully | Slightly more complex |
| org-roam integration | Respect existing workflows | Must detect and handle properties |
| Subtree export support | Enable multi-post files | Need narrowing detection |

* Integration Points

** org-roam
- Keyword insertion respects =:PROPERTIES:= blocks
- Helper function: =org-astro--upsert-keyword-after-roam=
- Searches for roam preamble (=- Links ::=, =- Source ::=) and inserts after

** Astro Framework
- Generates ES6 imports compatible with Astro's asset system
- Uses Astro alias paths (=~/=) for robustness
- Outputs MDX format with front matter Astro expects
- Image components use =astro:assets=

** Org Export Framework
- Registers as derived backend: =(org-export-define-derived-backend 'astro 'md ...)=
- Hooks into filter system: =:filter-parse-tree=, =:filter-body=, =:filter-final-output=
- Overrides specific transcoders in =:translate-alist=
- Uses standard =:options-alist= for keyword mapping

* State Management

** Global State
- =org-astro--current-body-images-imports= — Fallback storage for image imports
- =org-astro-debug-images= — Debug mode flag

** Export Info Plist
Keys stored in =info= during export:
- =:astro-body-images-imports= — Image import data
- =:destination-folder= — Target folder
- =:slug= — Post slug
- =:title=, =:date=, =:excerpt=, etc. — Front matter fields

** File System State
- Source Org files updated with new asset paths
- Assets copied to Astro project directories
- MDX files written to destination

* Error Handling & Edge Cases

** Defensive Patterns
- Always check for nil before =cl-find=
- Validate data structures before processing
- Use proper escape sequences in regex
- Trim whitespace in config lookups
- Handle missing information with defaults or prompts

** Common Edge Cases
1. **Files starting with numbers** → Prepend =img= to variable name
2. **Spaces in filenames** → Sanitize with hyphens, URL-encode for PDFs
3. **Remote images** → Download before processing
4. **Protocol-relative URLs** → Convert to =https://=
5. **Narrowed buffers** → Detect and search within visible region
6. **Missing metadata** → Use fallbacks or generate from content
7. **Trailing spaces in config** → Trim during lookup

* Performance Considerations

** Two-Pass Export System
The exporter runs twice to ensure all images are processed:
1. First pass: Initial processing and import generation
2. Second pass: Re-collection to catch any updates

*Why*: Downloaded images and updated paths need to be re-collected for proper import generation.

** Asset Copying Strategy
- Copy-on-export: Assets copied during export, not build time
- Post-specific folders: Prevent filename collisions
- Sanitization: Web-safe filenames reduce build issues

* Debugging & Troubleshooting

** Debug System
Enable with: =(setq org-astro-debug-images t)=

Features:
- Detailed logging to =ox-astro-debug.log=
- Automatic clipboard copy of file paths
- Session headers with timestamps
- Image processing trace
- Gallery debugging

** Common Issues & Solutions

| Issue | Likely Cause | Check |
|-------|-------------|-------|
| Images not imported | Data lost between phases | =org-astro--current-body-images-imports= |
| Wrong slug used | Multiple slug generation points | Search all 3 locations |
| Keyword in wrong place | Not using upsert helper | Use =org-astro--upsert-keyword-after-roam= |
| Config not found | Whitespace mismatch | Check for trailing spaces |
| Subtree export fails | Narrowing not detected | Verify =buffer-narrowed-p= logic |

* Future Considerations

See [[file:critical-next-steps.org][critical-next-steps.org]] for roadmap. Architectural considerations:

- **Slug consolidation**: Centralize slug generation logic
- **Caching layer**: Avoid re-processing unchanged assets
- **Parallel processing**: Handle multiple images concurrently
- **Plugin system**: Allow user extensions for custom transformations
- **Template support**: Configurable front matter templates
