* Purpose

This directory contains archived documentation that has been superseded by newer files or is no longer actively maintained but preserved for historical reference.

* Archived Files

- =learnings.org= - Original learning documentation, superseded by [[file:../codebase-wisdom.org][codebase-wisdom.org]]

* When to Archive

Archive documentation when:
- It has been superseded by a newer, better-organized file
- The feature/approach it documents has been completely replaced
- The content is outdated but contains historical value
- You need to preserve the evolution of thinking

* When to Delete

Delete documentation outright when:
- It's completely obsolete with no historical value
- It contains incorrect information that could mislead
- It's a temporary scratch file with no useful content
