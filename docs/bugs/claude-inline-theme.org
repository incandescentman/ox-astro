#+TITLE: Inline Theme Keywords Not Emitted
#+DATE: 2025-12-02
#+STATUS: Open

* Problem Summary
Inline #+THEME: keywords placed immediately before the first heading were being suppressed, so the generated MDX lacked `{/* theme: claude */}` markers and the Claude styling did not apply.

* Expected Behavior
- Body-level THEME keywords should emit inline theme markers even when placed right before the first heading, provided they differ from the page theme.

* Actual Behavior
- The export suppressed THEME keywords that appeared before the first heading, so no inline theme marker was emitted and the Claude fonts/styles did not apply.

* Root Cause
- In `org-astro-keyword`, body-level was only true after the first heading. A THEME keyword before the first heading (used as an inline theme switch) was treated as frontmatter and dropped.

* Fix Implemented
- Allow THEME keywords to emit inline markers when their value differs from the page theme, even if they appear before the first heading.

* Files
- ox-astro-handlers.el — `org-astro-keyword` logic updated.

* Status
- Exporter fix is in; re-export content to restore inline theme markers. Avoid manual MDX edits.
