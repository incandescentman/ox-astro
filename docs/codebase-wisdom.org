#+TITLE: ox-astro Codebase Wisdom

* Setup / Environment

* Codebase Quirks

** Pattern: Export happens in two distinct phases requiring careful state management
- *Mechanism:* Pre-processing phase (lines 91-178 in ox-astro.el) handles images/PDFs, then main export phase (179+) handles metadata
- *Actionable insight:* When adding metadata like SLUG, it must be added in the metadata phase (around line 180+), not earlier

** Fact: The export narrowing context affects keyword detection
- *Mechanism:* When exporting a subtree or in narrowed buffer, `org-element-parse-buffer` only sees the narrowed region
- *Actionable insight:* Always check for both title-kw and slug-kw within the narrowed context to avoid duplicate additions

* Debugging Tactics

** Technique: Use file modification notifications to track external changes
- *Mechanism:* Claude Code provides system reminders when files are modified externally
- *Actionable insight:* Pay attention to these notifications - they indicate your code may have been overwritten

* Tool Oddities (Claude Code, etc.)

** Behavior: Emacs batch mode syntax errors can be cryptic
- *Example:* "Invalid read syntax: ")", 371, 21" means extra closing parenthesis at line 371
- *Actionable insight:* Count parentheses carefully when editing Lisp code, especially in complex let* forms
- Emacs has a function (check-parens) that can help. If you still have trouble fixing mismatched parentheses, ask user to help!

* ox-astro Specific Patterns

** Pattern: Keyword insertion uses `org-astro--upsert-keyword-after-roam`
- *Mechanism:* This function intelligently places keywords after org-roam properties
- *Actionable insight:* Always use this helper instead of manual insertion to maintain consistent formatting

** Pattern: Front matter data flows through multiple functions
- *Flow:* ox-astro.el generates keywords → info plist → ox-astro-helpers.el `org-astro--get-front-matter-data` → MDX
- *Actionable insight:* To add new metadata, update both the keyword generation AND the front matter assembly

** Gotcha: Slug generation logic was split across multiple locations
- *Locations:*
  - ox-astro.el lines 118-125 (for image processing)
  - ox-astro.el lines 187-214 (for metadata addition)
  - ox-astro-helpers.el lines 552-554 (for front matter)
- *Actionable insight:* When modifying slug behavior, check ALL three locations to ensure consistency
- Question: Is this OK? should we consolidate slug generation logic to one place?

** Gotcha: Whitespace in config folder nicknames causes lookup failures
- *Date:* 2025-10-05
- *Trigger:* `#+DESTINATION_FOLDER: socratic` failed with "not found" error even though "socratic " existed in config
- *Mechanism:* `assoc` performs exact string matching, so `"socratic"` ≠ `"socratic "` (trailing space)
- *The Fix:* Implemented whitespace-tolerant lookup using `cl-find` with `string-trim` on both input and config keys (ox-astro.el:243-245, 100-103)
- *Prevention:*
  - Always trim whitespace from user input before lookup
  - Use `cl-find` with custom `:test` function instead of `assoc` for fuzzy matching
  - This pattern applies to any user-facing configuration lookups
- *Actionable insight:* Configuration errors (trailing spaces, inconsistent formatting) should be handled gracefully rather than failing with cryptic errors

** Pattern: MDX Export Blocks for Raw JSX/Components
- *Date:* 2025-10-05
- *Use Case:* Embedding Astro/React components directly in Org files
- *Mechanism:* Use `#+BEGIN_EXPORT mdx` / `#+END_EXPORT` blocks to pass JSX/MDX through verbatim
- *Implementation:* Added `org-astro-export-block` transcoder that recognizes MDX, MARKDOWN, and MD export types
- *Example:*
  ```org
  #+BEGIN_EXPORT mdx
  import CopyPromptButton from '@jaydixit/astro-utils/components/CopyPromptButton.astro';

  export const promptText = `Your text here`;

  <CopyPromptButton text={promptText} buttonText="Click me" />
  #+END_EXPORT
  ```
- *Actionable insight:* For one-off component usage, export blocks are cleaner than creating special transcoding logic

** Gotcha: Export block indentation was converted to blockquotes
- *Date:* 2025-10-05
- *Trigger:* MDX export blocks with indented HTML (like `<button>`) were being converted to blockquote syntax (`> `)
- *Mechanism:*
  1. `org-astro-export-block` used `org-remove-indentation` which only removes *minimum* indentation, leaving some spaces
  2. `org-astro-final-output-filter` detects lines starting with 4+ spaces and converts them to blockquotes (`> `)
  3. The filter only skips this conversion for JSX components (uppercase tags like `<Image>`), not HTML elements (lowercase tags like `<div>`)
- *The Fix:* Changed export block handler to completely strip ALL leading whitespace: `(replace-regexp-in-string "^[ \t]+" "" content)`
- *Prevention:* Export blocks must output completely unindented content to avoid triggering the blockquote conversion logic
- *Actionable insight:* The final-output filter's blockquote conversion is aggressive - any content that should stay verbatim must have zero indentation
