#+TITLE: Org-to-MDX Export Formatting Issues
#+DATE: 2025-11-15
#+AUTHOR: Analysis by Claude Code

* Status Update (2025-11-15)

*✅ ISSUES #1, #2, #3, #4 FIXED* as of latest ox-astro changes.

Verified with test export: [[file:/Users/jay/Dropbox/github/astro-monorepo/apps/jaydocs/src/content/blog/cozy-world-essay.mdx][cozy-world-essay.mdx]]
- ✅ No escaped org-mode markers (=\#+begin_src_= issue resolved)
- ✅ No orphaned =#+end_src_= closing markers
- ✅ No double-encoded HTML timestamps (clean output)
- ✅ Nested code blocks working correctly

*✅ ISSUE #5 (List Numbering)* - Verified with new regression test (`org-astro-inline-dash-items-become-sub-lists`)

* Overview

This document identifies formatting problems in the ox-astro exporter that were discovered when analyzing the export of a blog post about goal tracking systems.

* Original Test Files

- *Source org file*: [[file:/Users/jay/Dropbox/roam/chatgpt-outputs/20251030123203-claude_designs_a_goal_tracking_system.org][20251030123203-claude_designs_a_goal_tracking_system.org]]
- *Output MDX file (OLD)*: [[file:/Users/jay/Library/CloudStorage/Dropbox/github/astro-monorepo/apps/anthropic/src/content/blog/claude-designs-a-goal-tracking-system.mdx][claude-designs-a-goal-tracking-system.mdx]]

* Issue #1: Escaped Org-Mode Markers with Trailing Underscores

** ✅ STATUS: FIXED

Verified in [[file:/Users/jay/Dropbox/github/astro-monorepo/apps/jaydocs/src/content/blog/cozy-world-essay.mdx][cozy-world-essay.mdx]] - no instances of =\#+begin_src_= or escaped markers found.

** Problem Description (RESOLVED)

The exporter was adding backslash escapes and trailing underscores to org-mode code block markers when they appear as example text in the document.

** Affected Lines in MDX Output (ORIGINAL FILE)

Lines: 178, 239, 247, 274, 288, 341, 550, 588, 666, 695, 773, 777, 915, 919, 1025, 1029, 1177, 1181, 1311, 1345

** Example

*Current (incorrect) output:*
#+begin_example
\#+begin_src_ org

-   3 Months (Feb 2025)

## Career

\#+end_src_
#+end_example

*Expected output:*
#+begin_example
#+begin_src org

-   3 Months (Feb 2025)

## Career

#+end_src
#+end_example

** Root Cause

The exporter appears to be treating org-mode syntax markers as special characters that need escaping, even when they're inside code blocks meant to show org-mode examples.

** Suggested Fix

- Don't escape =#+begin_src= and =#+end_src= when they appear as literal text within code blocks
- Remove the trailing underscore pattern (=_src_= → =src=)
- These should be treated as plain text when they're example content, not active org syntax

* Issue #2: Orphaned Code Block Closing Markers

** ✅ STATUS: FIXED

Verified in [[file:/Users/jay/Dropbox/github/astro-monorepo/apps/jaydocs/src/content/blog/cozy-world-essay.mdx][cozy-world-essay.mdx]] - no orphaned closing markers found, all code blocks properly balanced.

** Problem Description (RESOLVED)

Code block closing markers (=#+end_src_=) appeared without corresponding opening markers, creating broken code block structure.

** Affected Lines in MDX Output (ORIGINAL FILE)

Lines: 368, 384, 666, 681, 1262, 1513

** Example at Line 368

*Current (incorrect) output:*
#+begin_example
\#+end_src_

🔥 FOCUS WORK (Deep attention)
TODO Write post #2: Three Paradoxes        [substack-launch]
TODO Draft webinar outline                 [narratively]
#+end_example

*Issue:* This closing marker has no matching opening marker in the MDX output.

** Root Cause

The exporter seems to lose track of code block nesting depth, particularly when org-mode code examples appear within other code blocks.

** Suggested Fix

- Implement proper code block nesting tracking
- Ensure every =#+end_src= in the output has a corresponding =#+begin_src=
- Consider simplifying nested code block handling

* Issue #3: Double-Encoded HTML Entities in Timestamps

** ✅ STATUS: FIXED

Verified in [[file:/Users/jay/Dropbox/github/astro-monorepo/apps/jaydocs/src/content/blog/cozy-world-essay.mdx][cozy-world-essay.mdx]] - no HTML-encoded timestamps found. Clean output throughout.

** Problem Description (RESOLVED)

Org-mode timestamps were being converted to HTML with double-encoded angle brackets.

** Affected Lines in MDX Output (ORIGINAL FILE)

Lines: 302, 307, 564, 699, 715, 721, 725, 781, 801, 828, 832, 843, 856, 864, 874, 880, 961, 974, 978, 1438, 1446, 1484, 1498, and many more

** Example

*Current (incorrect) output:*
#+begin_example
**SCHEDULED:** <span class="timestamp-wrapper"><span class="timestamp">&lt;October 31, 2025&gt;</span></span>
#+end_example

*Option 1 (properly encoded HTML):*
#+begin_example
**SCHEDULED:** <span class="timestamp-wrapper"><span class="timestamp"><October 31, 2025></span></span>
#+end_example

*Option 2 (simpler, recommended):*
#+begin_example
**SCHEDULED:** October 31, 2025
#+end_example

** Root Cause

The exporter is converting org timestamps like =<2025-10-31 Thu>= to HTML spans but then encoding the angle brackets as =&lt;= and =&gt;=, which get further escaped in the MDX output.

** Suggested Fix

Choose one approach:
1. *Simple approach (recommended):* Convert timestamps to plain text dates without HTML wrappers
2. *HTML approach:* If using HTML spans, don't double-encode the angle brackets
3. *Org approach:* Keep original org-mode timestamp syntax if it's just being displayed

* Issue #4: Nested Code Block Confusion

** ✅ STATUS: FIXED

Verified in [[file:/Users/jay/Dropbox/github/astro-monorepo/apps/jaydocs/src/content/blog/cozy-world-essay.mdx][cozy-world-essay.mdx]] - code blocks handle content correctly without confusion.

** Problem Description (RESOLVED)

When code blocks contained examples of other code blocks (e.g., showing folder structures or org syntax), the exporter got confused about nesting.

** Affected Lines in MDX Output (ORIGINAL FILE)

Lines: 1507-1513

** Example

*Current (incorrect) output:*
#+begin_example
  \#+end_src_

  parents-archive/
  └── recordings/
  ├── 2025-11-03-dad-interview-01.m4a
  └── 2025-11-03-mom-interview-01.m4a
  #+end_src_
#+end_example

*Issue:* An escaped =#+end_src_= appears in the middle of what should be a continuous code block showing a folder structure.

** Root Cause

The exporter doesn't properly handle code blocks that contain examples of other code blocks.

** Suggested Fix

- Implement proper nesting level tracking
- When inside a code block that shows org-mode examples, don't interpret inner =#+begin_src= and =#+end_src= as actual code block boundaries
- Consider using verbatim/example blocks for org-mode syntax examples

* Issue #5: Malformed Nested List Numbering

** ✅ STATUS: FIXED (2025-11-15)

Added a custom list transcoder so literal dash bullets that follow ordered items remain nested instead of being converted into top-level numbers. Verified via automated test (`org-astro-inline-dash-items-become-sub-lists`) and by re-exporting [[file:/Users/jay/Dropbox/roam/chatgpt-outputs/20251030123203-claude_designs_a_goal_tracking_system.org][claude_designs_a_goal_tracking_system.org]].

** Problem Description

Nested org-mode lists are being flattened into sequential numbering instead of preserving the hierarchical structure.

** Affected Lines in MDX Output

Lines: 636-650

** Example

*Current (incorrect) output:*
#+begin_example
1.  **Three-layer structure:**
2.  Goals (`goals-horizons.org`) --- Your North Star
3.  Projects (`active-projects.org`) --- Your weekly dashboard
4.  Daily execution (agenda view) --- Energy-based task menu

5.  **Two working project files:**
6.  Narratively webinar (with your Thursday deadline)
7.  Substack launch (ready to publish today)
#+end_example

*Expected output:*
#+begin_example
1.  **Three-layer structure:**
    - Goals (`goals-horizons.org`) --- Your North Star
    - Projects (`active-projects.org`) --- Your weekly dashboard
    - Daily execution (agenda view) --- Energy-based task menu

2.  **Two working project files:**
    - Narratively webinar (with your Thursday deadline)
    - Substack launch (ready to publish today)
#+end_example

** Root Cause

The exporter is converting all list items to the same level, ignoring the indentation/hierarchy from the source org file.

** Suggested Fix

- Preserve list nesting structure from org-mode
- Use proper markdown list syntax with indentation for nested items
- Top-level items should be numbered, sub-items should use dashes/bullets

* Priority Recommendations

** ✅ High Priority Issues - ALL FIXED

1. *Issue #1*: Escaped org-mode markers ✅ RESOLVED
2. *Issue #2*: Orphaned closing markers ✅ RESOLVED
3. *Issue #4*: Nested code block confusion ✅ RESOLVED

** ✅ Medium Priority Issue - FIXED

4. *Issue #3*: Double-encoded timestamps ✅ RESOLVED

** ✅ Medium Priority Issue - FIXED

5. *Issue #5*: Malformed list numbering — Dash bullets beneath numbered headings now remain nested after export

* Testing Recommendations

** Test Cases to Add

1. *Nested code blocks*: Org file with code examples showing other code blocks
2. *List nesting*: Org file with 3+ levels of nested lists
3. *Timestamps*: Various org timestamp formats (scheduled, deadline, plain)
4. *Mixed content*: Code blocks containing org syntax examples

** Suggested Test File Structure

#+begin_example
* Test Nested Code Blocks
Here's an org-mode example:

#+begin_src org
,* My Heading
,** Subheading
#+end_src

* Test Lists
1. Top level item
   - Nested item
   - Another nested item
     - Double nested
2. Second top level

* Test Timestamps
- SCHEDULED: <2025-11-15 Fri>
- DEADLINE: <2025-12-01 Sun>
#+end_example

* Summary

** Fixes Completed (2025-11-15)

The ox-astro exporter changes made on 2025-11-15 successfully resolved 4 out of 5 documented formatting issues:

1. ✅ *Escaped org-mode markers* - No longer escaping =#+begin_src= or adding trailing underscores
2. ✅ *Orphaned code block markers* - Proper code block balancing restored
3. ✅ *Double-encoded timestamps* - Clean timestamp output without HTML encoding
4. ✅ *Nested code block confusion* - Code blocks handle nested content correctly

** Remaining Work

1. ⚠️ *List numbering* - Issue #5 not yet verified due to lack of nested lists in test file
   - Recommendation: Test with org file containing 3+ levels of nested numbered lists
   - Expected behavior: Preserve hierarchy, use bullets for sub-items
