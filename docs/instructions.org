#+TITLE: ox-astro Operational Instructions
#+DATE: 2025-10-20

* Pre-Session Ritual
- Read the latest entry in =docs/work-log.org= for active context
- Check =docs/codebase-wisdom.org= for relevant gotchas
- Review =docs/design-architecture.org= for any architecture implications
- Compare your local export hooks when behavior diverges. Run
  =(list org-export-before-processing-functions org-export-before-parsing-functions)=
  and ensure nothing custom strips =[[id:...]]= links. Divergent results between
  machines usually mean a hook or config difference, not exporter code.

* Export Workflow
1. Open the source Org buffer
2. Ensure either =#+DESTINATION_FOLDER:=, =#+DESTINATION-FOLDER:=, or =#+ASTRO_POSTS_FOLDER:= points to a configured nickname
3. Run =M-x org-astro-export-to-mdx=
4. Inspect any warnings emitted in the minibuffer or =*Messages*=
5. If the buffer is narrowed, the export treats it as a subtree (both passes).
6. If the title keyword or filename is purely numeric date-like, the first heading becomes the title/slug/outfile (later non-date =#+TITLE= wins when present).

* ID-Based Link Resolution
- The exporter builds an ID→path map by scanning all =.org= files under =org-astro-source-root-folder=
- During export, =[[id:...][Label]]= links become standard Markdown links pointing to the correct =.mdx= output
- Astro export now sanitizes known-destructive hooks (e.g., =org-export-id-link-removal=), but
  always double-check local hook lists if links disappear—the sanitization only helps when the
  hook name is on our blocklist.
- Relative paths mirror your Org directory structure (e.g., `[Mom](../characters/mom.mdx)`); configure destinations with =:preserve-folder-structure t= to keep nested collections aligned
- Missing IDs trigger a warning and the link degrades to plain text while remaining readable
- After export, check =broken-links.json= in the destination root for unresolved IDs
- Fix missing targets by adding the note (with matching =:ID:=) and re-exporting

* Configuration Checklist
- Set =org-astro-source-root-folder= to the top-level directory containing your org-roam notes
- Add a destination nickname with =:preserve-folder-structure t= if you want exports to mirror the roam hierarchy
- Verify your notes include =:ID:= drawers when you expect cross-note linking

* Image Configuration

** Responsive Images (Default)
By default, ox-astro generates =<Image />= components with =layout="responsive"=, which enables Astro 5.10+'s automatic srcset and sizes generation for optimal performance.

#+begin_src emacs-lisp
;; Default (responsive images enabled)
(setq org-astro-image-default-layout "responsive")
#+end_src

** Layout Options
- ="responsive"= (default): Image scales with container, auto srcset
- ="fixed"=: Image maintains exact dimensions
- ="full-width"=: Image spans full container width
- =nil= or ="none"=: No layout prop (basic behavior, pre-5.10 compatibility)

** Disabling Responsive Images
To revert to basic image behavior without the layout prop:

#+begin_src emacs-lisp
(setq org-astro-image-default-layout nil)
#+end_src

* Verifying Broken Links
- Open the generated MDX file and click through the links to confirm navigation
- Review =broken-links.json= and resolve outstanding IDs before publishing
- Re-export once missing IDs exist—the links will auto-heal on the next run

* Metadata Fields
- The exporter recognizes both plain and =ASTRO_= prefixed keywords for enriched front matter.
- Supported mappings:
  - =#+date_occurred:= → `dateOccurred` (ISO date)
  - =#+era:= → `era`
  - =#+place:= → `place`
  - =#+people:= → `people` array (comma or whitespace separated)
  - =#+emotions:= → `emotions` array
  - =#+places:= → `places` array
  - =#+themes:= → `themes` array
  - =#+story_type:= → `storyType` (validated against `full-story`, `vignette`, `snapshot`, `fragment`)
- Arrays accept quoted multi-word tokens (e.g., =#+people: "Mom's apartment"=).
- After enriching an Org note, re-export to confirm the MDX front matter includes the expected fields.
