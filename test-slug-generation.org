#+TITLE: Test Slug Generation Feature
#+AUTHOR: Jay Dixit
#+DESTINATION_FOLDER: jaydocs

This is a test file to verify that:

1. A slug is automatically generated from the title
2. The slug is added to both the Org source file (as #+SLUG:)
3. The slug appears in the MDX front matter

Let's see if this works correctly!
