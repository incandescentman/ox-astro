#+TITLE: Test Slug Generation Feature
#+AUTHOR: Jay Dixit
#+DESTINATION_FOLDER: jaydocs

This is a test file to verify that:

1. A slug is automatically generated from the title
2. The slug is added to both the Org source file (as #+SLUG:)
3. The exported filename and asset folders use the slug (front matter no longer includes it)

Let's see if this works correctly!
