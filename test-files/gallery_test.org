* Gallery test

Above is the hero image. It should not appear in the gallery since it is not part of a two-or-more sequence of images with no text in between.

Below is another image. It should not appear in a gallery, since it is by itself:

Here are three images in a row with no text in between. Since they are 2 or more images in a row, they should create a gallery, and should not appear as Image src tags below. If there are any Image src tags below this line, that is an error of the exporter:
