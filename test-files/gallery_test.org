* Gallery test 
[[/Users/jay/Library/CloudStorage/Dropbox/github/astro-monorepo/apps/jaydocs/src/assets/images/posts/gallery-test/hero-image.webp]]

Above is the hero image. It should not appear in the gallery since it is not part of a two-or-more sequence of images with no text in between.

Below is another image. It should not appear in a gallery, since it is by itself:

[[/Users/jay/Library/CloudStorage/Dropbox/github/astro-monorepo/apps/jaydocs/src/assets/images/posts/gallery-test/solo-by-itself.jpg]]

Here are three images in a row with no text in between. Since they are 2 or more images in a row, they should create a gallery, and should not appear as Image src tags below. If there are any Image src tags below this line, that is an error of the exporter:

[[/Users/jay/Library/CloudStorage/Dropbox/github/astro-monorepo/apps/jaydocs/src/assets/images/posts/gallery-test/gallery-1.jpg]]

[[/Users/jay/Library/CloudStorage/Dropbox/github/astro-monorepo/apps/jaydocs/src/assets/images/posts/gallery-test/gallery-2.jpg]]

[[/Users/jay/Library/CloudStorage/Dropbox/github/astro-monorepo/apps/jaydocs/src/assets/images/posts/gallery-test/gallery-3.webp]]
