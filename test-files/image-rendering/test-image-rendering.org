#+TITLE: Image Rendering Test
#+SLUG: image-rendering-test
#+DESTINATION_FOLDER: test-export

This file exercises multiple image references so the export pipeline can be
validated end-to-end.

* Linked Images
- Described local image → [[file:images/local-photo.png][Local Photo Described]]
- Undescribed local image → [[file:images/local-photo.png]]

* Raw Absolute Path
The exporter should rewrite this raw path and still render an Image component:
{{ABS_LOCAL}}

* Remote Image
https://example.com/assets/remote-fixture.png

* Paths With Spaces
- Described: [[file:images/space name image.jpg][Space Name]]
- Raw: {{ABS_SPACE}}

* Underscore Variants
- [[file:images/underscore_image.PNG]]

# Local photo referenced a second time to ensure duplicates render.
Another reminder of the same file: [[file:images/local-photo.png][Third mention]]
