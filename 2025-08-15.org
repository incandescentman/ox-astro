Is milan worth seeing? when I was there for just an afternoon near stazione centrale it seemed pretty dead, and run down
#+end_SRC

Absolutely---despite your brief, underwhelming afternoon near Milano Centrale, Milan is absolutely worth seeing. That area is largely a transit and business zone, so it offers a limited impression of the city's true character. Once you move beyond the station, Milan reveals a rich mix of historic grandeur, cutting-edge culture, and vibrant urban life.

*** What Makes Milan Worth It
- *Architectural & Cultural Icons*
  The *Duomo di Milano* is a breathtaking Gothic cathedral and one of Europe's largest---it anchors Piazza del Duomo and defines the heart of the city. Nearby, the stunning *Galleria Vittorio Emanuele II* offers elegant shopping under its famous glass dome ([Tripadvisor][1], [Stasher][2]).

- *World-Class Art & Museums*
  You can admire masterpieces by Leonardo da Vinci, Michelangelo, Caravaggio, and more in institutions like the *Pinacoteca di Brera*, *Castello Sforzesco*, and *Santa Maria delle Grazie* (home of *The Last Supper*) ([Wikipedia][3]).

- *Modern Renewal & Creativity*
  Milan is not just about the past---it is renowned for its innovation in design, fashion, and urban transformation. Districts like *Porta Nuova* and *CityLife* feature stylish skyscrapers, revitalized public spaces, and vibrant contemporary aesthetics ([Condé Nast Traveler][4], [Wikipedia][3]).

- *Dynamic Neighborhoods & Lifestyle*
  From picturesque canals and aperitivo culture in *Navigli*, to opera at *La Scala*, diverse museums and leafy *Parco Sempione*, Milan offers a richly layered experience ([Wikipedia][5], [The Times][6]).

- *Ease of Getting Around & Day Trips*
  Milan is exceptionally walkable---with 98% of residents living in 15-minute neighborhoods ([beyondyellowbrickblog.com][7], [Wikipedia][3])---and its public transit is efficient. It also serves as a great hub for train day trips to charming nearby towns like *Brescia*, *Modena*, *Parma*, or *Lake Como* ([Business Insider][8]).

*** But... It May Not Be for Everyone
- Some travelers describe Milan as *cold, fast-paced*, and *less romantic* than iconic cities like Rome or Florence. A Business Insider traveler, for instance, felt Milan lacked historic charm and pivoted to quieter towns nearby for a more fulfilling experience ([Business Insider][8]).

- Others note it can feel crowded, not as scenic, at times dusty, and food may not always match expectations---especially if you're seeking the postcard-perfect Italy ([Dream Plan Experience][9]).

*** A Refined Recommendation
| Your Experience                                     | What to Do Instead                                                                                                                                                                       |
|-----------------------------------------------------+------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| Visiting only the area around the station felt dull | Venture beyond: head to the *Duomo*, *Brera*, *Navigli*, *Sforzesco*, or *Parco Sempione*                                                                                                          |
| Short on time                                       | Focus on a curated 3-4 hour walking route: *Duomo*, rooftop views, *Galleria Vittorio*, then a stroll through *Via Dante* toward *Castello* ([Rick Steves Community][10], [The Travel Folk][11]) |
| Still craving more after a day                      | Use Milan as a base to explore *Lake Como* or artisanal towns like *Parma* or *Modena*---accessible by train ([Business Insider][8], [Stasher][2], [The Times][6])                             |

*** Final Thought
Think of Milan as a city of striking contrasts---historic and sleek, artistic and modern, cultured and practical. If your glimpse was brief and limited to the Central Station area, you likely missed Milan's real pulse. Give it more breathing space, and you'll find a city that's rewarding in uniquely Milanese ways.

#+begin_src user
I'm currently in Locarno. How easy is it for me to get to Geneva or Zurich? Which is easier? Are they both easy? How would I get there? What if I went to Milan first and were coming from there?

Besides Milan, are there mind-blowingly phenomenal destinations that are less expensive than Switzerland where I could spend Aug 17 - 20?

Here is the context.
I am currently in Locarno. This is 5pm Aug 15.
I check out of my Airbnb in Locarno on the morning of Aug 17.
I am meeting Stephen either in Zurich or Geneva on Aug 20.
I need somewhere to stay Aug 17 - 20.
Switzerland seems expensive! But I am open to Switzerland if there are places that are not insanely expensive.

Please only suggest places that are either cheap flights from Zurich or Milan, or close enough to get to via train. e.g. Budapest is out because it takes around 18-21 hours to get there via train, or a flight that's not cheap.
#+end_SRC

Short answer: from Locarno, *Zürich is much easier than Geneva*. And yes---there are several phenomenal, cheaper bases in *Northern Italy* for Aug 17-20 that still keep you close to Zürich or Geneva for Aug 20.

** Getting to Zürich or Geneva from Locarno
- *Locarno → Zürich HB*
  Fast, frequent, and mostly direct via the Ceneri/Gotthard base tunnels. Typical time ≈ *2 h 30-2 h 45*; some trains are as quick as \~2 h 10. ([Trainline][1], [Omio][2])

- *Locarno → Geneva*
  Longer and with changes (usually Bellinzona/Arth-Goldau + Lausanne). Realistic time *\~5-6 h* (site estimates vary; plan \~5 h+). ([Omio][3], [Trainline][4])

*Verdict:* If you're picking purely for ease from Locarno on Aug 20, *meet in Zürich*.

** If you swing through Milan first
- *Locarno → Milan*
  Direct TILO *RE80* now uses the Ceneri Base Tunnel; fastest runs *\~1 h 55-2 h 07*. ([tilo][5], [Trainline][6], [Omio][7])
- *Milan → Zürich*
  Direct EuroCity through the Gotthard Base Tunnel, fastest *\~3 h 17* (many runs 3 h 30-4 h+). ([Swiss ASAP][8], [Trainline][9])
- *Milan → Geneva*
  Typically *\~5 h 40* on the fastest itineraries (often 1 change). ([Trainline][10], [Omio][11])

*Verdict:* If you go to Milan, *Zürich remains the easier meet-up*.

** Aug 17-20: stellar, lower-cost bases (easy by train from Locarno or Milan)
All of these are substantially cheaper than Swiss resort towns in mid-August and keep you within a quick train hop to Zürich/Geneva on the 20th.

- *Bergamo (Città Alta)* - atmospheric hilltown + excellent food; from Milan in *\~50-60 min* Regionale; from Locarno go via Milan. (Then Milan → Zürich on the 20th is easy.) ([Trainline][12])
- *Verona* - walkable, gorgeous, and great value in August; *\~1 h 10-1 h 20* from Milan on Frecciarossa/Italo. ([Trainline][13], [ItaliaRail][14])
- *Bologna* - foodie heaven, lively but not overrun; *\~1 h 15-1 h 30* from Milan on Frecciarossa. ([Trainline][15], [ItaliaRail][16])
- *Turin (Torino)* - elegant, underrated, prices friendly; *\~45-90 min* from Milan on HS trains. ([Trainline][17])
- *Genoa (Genova)* - characterful port city + quick access to Camogli/Santa Margherita; *\~1 h 27-2 h* from Milan. (Cinque Terre is pricier/crowded; base in Genoa or *Levanto* instead.) ([Trainline][18], [ItaliaRail][19], [Rail Europe][20], [Italo][21])
- *Lake Garda (Desenzano or Peschiera)* - lakeside vibe without Swiss prices; *\~1 h-1 h 30* from Milan. ([Trainline][13])

: Practical flow for you:
>
: * *Aug 17 (Sat):* Locarno → Milan (≈2 h). Same day hop to your chosen city above (≈45-90 min more in most cases). ([Trainline][6])
: * *Aug 19 (Mon) evening or Aug 20 (Tue) early:* Train back via *Milan → Zürich* (≈3 h 17-4 h) or *Milan → Geneva* (fastest \~5 h 40). Meet Stephen. ([Trainline][9])

** Why not just stay in Switzerland?
You can! But even secondary Swiss cities are pricey in mid-August. If you want Swiss scenery on a budget, the trade-offs are usually *hostels, simple guesthouses, or last-minute deals*---and you'll still pay more than comparable stays in Northern Italy.

** Booking/route tips (quick wins)
- Check *SBB* for Locarno legs and *Trenitalia/Italo* for Italy; buy HS trains in advance for cheaper fares. ([SBB Online Portal][22], [Trenitalia][23])
- The *Gotthard Base Tunnel* is what makes the Zürich route so fast---take advantage of those direct EuroCity trains. ([Condé Nast Traveler][24])
- If you'll fly, prioritize airports with lots of low-cost options: *Milan Bergamo (BGY)* and *Milan Malpensa (MXP)* over Zürich---but given the short window, *trains will likely beat flights on total time + hassle*.

If you tell me which vibe you want (food-obsessed, artsy, lakeside, nightlife, or "quiet + pretty + cheap"), I'll map a door-to-door micro-itinerary from Locarno on Aug 17 through your meet-up city on Aug 20---train numbers and ideal departure times included.

I want to get a beautiful sunny Airbnb that's affordable where I can do some writing. Don't need to do a ton of sightseeing. Ease of travel and vibe more important than touristy attractions. That said, I will spend 2 hours per day roaming, so some beautiful things to see would be cool
#+end_SRC

Got it --- sounds like you want somewhere that:

- Is *cheaper than Switzerland*
- Has *easy train access from Locarno* (or via Milan) and back to Zürich or Geneva on Aug 20
- Offers *good weather, light, and vibe* for writing
- Has *some beauty within a short walk* for your daily two-hour wander

Here's a short list that hits those criteria:

** 1. Bergamo (Città Alta) - Romantic hilltop calm
- *Why it works for you:*

  - Old stone streets, sunny piazzas, mountain views --- perfect for daily 2-hour wanders.
  - Quiet side streets and apartments in the upper town get great light.
  - Food is excellent and inexpensive.
- *Ease of travel:*

  - Locarno → Milan (≈2 h) → Bergamo (≈50-60 min train).
  - On Aug 20: Bergamo → Milan → Zürich (\~4-5 h total).
- *Airbnb rates:* €60-90/night for bright, charming flats.

** 2. Verona - Warm-toned, easygoing elegance
- *Why it works for you:*

  - Amber-colored buildings, Roman arena, river walks --- stunning but not overwhelming.
  - Cafés with outdoor tables for writing.
  - Very walkable and photogenic without constant tourist pressure.
- *Ease of travel:*

  - Locarno → Milan (\~2 h) → Verona (\~1 h 10 min on high-speed).
  - Aug 20: Verona → Milan → Zürich (\~4-5 h).
- *Airbnb rates:* €70-100/night for a light-filled 1BR with balcony.

** 3. Turin - Elegant, spacious, literary
- *Why it works for you:*

  - Wide boulevards, arcades for shade, mountain backdrop.
  - Known for cafés where writers linger for hours.
  - Cultural vibe without being jammed with tourists.
- *Ease of travel:*

  - Locarno → Milan (\~2 h) → Turin (\~45-60 min).
  - Aug 20: Turin → Milan → Zürich (\~4 h).
- *Airbnb rates:* €60-85/night for stylish central apartments with big windows.

** 4. Genoa - Lively port city with hidden quiet corners
- *Why it works for you:*

  - Narrow medieval lanes, harbor views, nearby small coastal towns for your walks (e.g., Camogli).
  - Cheaper than Cinque Terre, still gets sea breezes.
  - Nice mix of bustle and retreat spots.
- *Ease of travel:*

  - Locarno → Milan (\~2 h) → Genoa (\~1 h 30 min).
  - Aug 20: Genoa → Milan → Zürich (\~4-5 h).
- *Airbnb rates:* €55-80/night for sunny lofts in historic buildings.

** Recommendation for you
If your *#1 priority* is light, beauty, and a calm space for writing, *Bergamo's Città Alta* or *Turin* are ideal --- both have that "settle in and exhale" vibe, easy train links, and affordable yet beautiful apartments.

If you want *sea air* and more sensory buzz, *Genoa* is your spot.
If you want *golden, postcard-pretty streets*, choose *Verona*.

If you'd like, I can pick one city and give you a *door-to-door Aug 17-20 travel plan* with ideal train times, plus 3 handpicked Airbnb neighborhoods that get afternoon sun for writing. That would lock in the "easy + affordable + beautiful" trifecta for you.
