⏺ Analysis of Output

  ✅ Working Well:

  1. All 4 images successfully processed - QR1_0941.jpg, QR1_0928.jpg, IMG-5022-scaled.jpg, and the downloaded Substack image
  2. Imports generated correctly - All images have proper import statements with camelCase variable names
  3. Source file updated - The org file now has all images pointing to the assets folder
  4. MDX components rendered - 3 out of 4 images appear as <Image> components

  ⚠️ Issue Found:

  Missing Image in Body: QR1_0941.jpg is imported but not displayed in the MDX body. It's used as the hero image in frontmatter but doesn't appear as an <Image> component in the content.

  Looking at the MDX:
 - Line 14: import qr10941 from '~/assets/images/posts/image-link-test/QR1-0941.jpg'; ✅
 - Line 8: Used as hero image in frontmatter ✅
 - Lines 23-27: Only 3 <Image> components (qr10928, img5022Scaled, and the Substack image) ❌

  The first image (QR1_0941.jpg) is missing from the body content even though it's imported.

  Debug Log Analysis:

  The debug log shows all 4 images were collected from the updated source paths in the assets folder, which confirms the processing worked correctly.

  Summary:

  The image processing pipeline is working correctly now - Downloads images are being copied to assets and imported. However, there seems to be a rendering issue where one of the images (QR1_0941)
  isn't being included in the MDX body content, possibly because it's being used as the hero image and filtered out from the body.
